About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes files which can be used as a starting template for ARM9
projects, using Autotools for a build system. Even if one does not wish to use
Autotools for build system management, some files within the template may still
be of interest, such as the start.s, which contains a fairly comprehensive set
of initialization functions and some comments.

Setting up Autotools requires knowing about Autoconf and Automake in particular.
No tutorial on how to set these up will be supplied here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The make program itself. This repository has not been tested with any other
   make than GNU make. Please report incompatibilites to the issue tracker. Also
   note, that Autotools may not like to work with make programs other than GNU
   make.

 - Autotools, in particular Autoconf and Automake. Libtool may be needed if
   one wants to make libraries.

Issues/Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please report these to the issue tracker at the repository, and these will be
addressed as soon as possible, if not at least acknowledged. The more detailed
the reports, the more likely they are to be addressed quickly. In particular,
the following information can be quite useful when debugging bugs:

 - Type of 2/3DS system
 - Operating system being used to compile
 - Release/commit of project in use
 - Steps to reproduce issue
 - Expected behavior
 - Actual behavior
 - ARM9 entry point
 - Any modifications to the project, or extensions

Contributing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pull requests are welcome. All requests will be looked at in detail, and must be
documented in a similar fashion as the rest of the code for this project. In
particular, it is unlikely (but not impossible) that code that emmits warnings
with the warnings in use by this project would be merged without first fixing/
addressing what is causing the warnings to be emitted.
